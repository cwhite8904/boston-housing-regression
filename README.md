# üè° Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to predict housing prices in the Boston area using a variety of features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and accessibility to highways. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, model training, and performance evaluation.

By comparing **Linear Regression** with **Random Forest Regressor**, and applying **hyperparameter tuning**, we build a robust model capable of forecasting the median value of homes (`MEDV`). The final model is saved and ready for deployment or integration into dashboards and applications.
